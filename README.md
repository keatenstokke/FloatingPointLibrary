# FloatingPointLibrary
A Library of FSM-based Floating-Point Arithmetic Functions on FPGAs.

This repository provides the Verilog code for a library of FSM-based floating-point functions. The functions provided are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, sine, cosine, arcsine, and arccosine. The library utilizes the IEEE 754 single-precision 32-bit floating point format.
